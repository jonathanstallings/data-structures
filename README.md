Implementation of LinkedList and Stack data structures in Python.

##LinkedList

Available methods inlude:
* insert(val)
* pop()
* size()
* search(val)
* remove(node)
* display()

See the doc strings for implementation details.

##Stack
The Stack data class is a first-in-first-out data structure built via composition from LinkedList.
Available methods include:
* push(value)
* pop()

##Dequeque
The Dequeue data class is a first-in-last-out data structure built via encapsulation of a LinkedList.
Available methods inlude:
* enqueque(value)
* dequeque()
* len()
