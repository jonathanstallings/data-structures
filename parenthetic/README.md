#Parenthetics
Parenthetics includes an eponymous function which takes a string
argument and determines whether or not it has broken, open, or well-formed
parentheses.

##Illustrative Examples of functionality
These are all simplified examples. Any unicode characters can be
intersperced into any of the following.

###Case One: Broken Parentheses

All of the following arguments will return -1:
```
>>>  parenthetical("))))(((")
>>>  parenthetical(")")
>>>  parenthetical("()()()()()))(()))()(((()")
```
###Case Two: Open Parentheses

All of the following will return 1:
```
>>>  parenthetical("()(")
>>>  parenthetical("()()()(")
>>>  parenthetical("()()(((()()()")
```

###Case Three: Okay Parentheses
All of the following will return 0:
```
>>>  parenthetical("()()()()")
>>>  parenthetical("(())")
>>>  parenthetical("((()())()()())")
```

The "goose typing" coin was termed in an amusing little article by

I'm tempted to do a lightining talk on it.
