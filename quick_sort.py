"""This module contains the quick sort method (quick_srt), which performs an
in-place sort on a passed in list. Quick sort has a best case time
complexity of O(n log n) when all elements are equal, and a worst case of
O(n2). Quick sort is not stable or adaptive, but it is robust and has low
overhead.

This module was completed with reference to:

Quicksort: A Python Implementation
