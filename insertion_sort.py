"""This module contains the insertion sort method, which performs an
in-place sort on a passed in list. Insertion sort has a best case timeit
complexity of O(n) when list is nearly sorted, and a worst case of O(n2)
when the incoming list is already reverse sorted. While this not always
the most efficient algorithm, it is still popular when the data is nearly
sorted (because it is adaptive) or when the problem size is small.
See the excellent 'sortingalgorithms.com' for more information.
